# Steps to Generate an App Password

1. Go to your Google Account Security Settings:

- Open a web browser and go to your Google Account Security page.

2. Enable 2-Step Verification (if you haven’t already):

- Scroll down to the "Signing in to Google" section.
- If 2-Step Verification is not enabled, you'll need to enable it first by clicking on 2-Step Verification and following the setup process (this will include linking your phone number for verification).

3. Create an App Password:

- Once 2-Step Verification is enabled, go back to the Security page.
- Find the App passwords section and click on it.
- You may be asked to sign in again for security purposes.

4. Generate the App Password:

- In the "Select app" dropdown, choose Mail.
- In the "Select device" dropdown, select the device you are using (you can select "Other" and enter your app name if it’s not listed).
- Click on Generate.

5. Copy the App Password:

- Google will generate a 16-character password that looks like this: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`.
- Copy this password, and use it in your code as the value for the pass field

- Note : Do not expose the pass code publically or in code make it as environment variable
